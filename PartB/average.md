## 1. Problem Statement: Finding the Average

Given a set of numbers, how can we find their average?

Example: Given the numbers [5, 8, 12, 4, 10], calculate the average.

## 2. Develop pseudo code to solve the problem statement outlined in Step 1.
Use descriptive variable names and comments to enhance readability and understanding.
```
BEGIN
  //Initiate the list variable with values
  SET numbers_list TO [5, 8, 12, 4, 10]

  // Initiate both the sum and count variables to zero
  SET sum TO 0
  SET count TO 0

  // Loop through each number in order to find the sum and count
  FOR EACH number IN numbers_list
    SET sum TO sum + number
    SET count TO count + 1
  END FOR

  // Create an 'average' variable and calculate
  SET average TO sum / count

  // Print the result
  PRINT "The average of the list of numbers is " + average
END

```

## 3. Write a Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar to describe the syntax of the problem statement.
Construct a parse tree based on the BNF grammar to visualize the syntactic structure of the problem.

### Grammar Rules For our Program

```
<program>	        --> begin <stmt_list> end

<stmt_list>		    --> <stmt> | <stmt> <stmt_list>

<stmt>			    --> <assign> | <for_stmt> | <print_stmt>

<assign>		    --> <id> = <expression>

<for_stmt>		    --> for each <id> in <expression> : <stmt_list> endfor

<print_stmt>		--> print <string> + <id>

<expression>		--> <expression> + <expression> | <expression> / <expression> | <id> | <list_literal> | <num>

<list_literal>		--> [ <num_list> ]

<num_list>		    --> <num> | <num>, <num_list>

<id>                --> number | numbers_list | sum | count | average

<num>			    --> 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9

<string>		    --> "The average of the list of numbers is"

```
### BNF Parse Tree for Problem "Solving an average()"

_Our goal is to contextually look at a submission for an average program problem as defined by the problem statement.

Using BNF, I would like to describe an average function with the input as a num_list[] defined as [5, 8, 12, 4, 10]. And we need to compute the average by taking the sum of each value, while also keeping a count of the list. 

### Program Example: Translated from our Pseudo Code
--- 
##### Program: Average with comments

```
#Begin the program
#Initate variables
numbers_list = [5, 8, 12, 4, 10]
sum = 0
count = 0
  
#Declare for loop using 'num' to iterate each number in the list
for num in numbers_list:
    sum = sum + num
    count = count + 1

#Outside the scope of the loop, we are creating a variable and calculating.
average = sum / count

#Print the result
print "The average of the list of numbers is" + average

#End of our program
```

Note, comments denoted by # are just to explain the coders thinking when translating from Pseudo to Python and are not going to be parsed for the tree. It is simply to convey an understanding to a new reader to help build familiarity through our chosen Python language for this assignment.

Suppose students have been asked to submit the assignment with no # comments, here is what it could look like:
#### Python Code submitted to our program without comments
```
numbers_list = [5, 8, 12, 4, 10]
sum = 0
count = 0

for num in numbers_list:
    sum = sum + num
    count = count + 1

average = sum / count

print "The average of the list of numbers is" + average

```

Parse Tree
------

Given further analysis of the problem, here is a parse tree which follows the BNF defined from the "**Grammar Rules For our Program**" section.

## 4. Examine the parse tree constructed in Step 4 to determine if the BNF grammar is ambiguous.
Identify any areas where multiple interpretations are possible.
Provide examples or scenarios to illustrate potential ambiguities and their implications.

### Scenario:  Concatenation of string with variable.
----
Given the <string> and <id> for a variable. We are intending a print to our command line using the variable and predefined stringed text.
There may be an overload given the differences in operation if this is not addressed within the Lexical Anaylzer.

For example
```
print("Some text" + variable)

```
Where the variable may not be of string type, the print will catch and overload the method. However in modeling the BNF, we must determine the scenario in which text may be combined with an operation '+' such that the value from the <num> type is displayed to a user given the precondition of 'print()'.

### Scenario:  Addition Expression Equivocations 
----
Given the behaviour differences in addition logic. A challenged faced internally amongst our group when analyzing different average code submissions.


**Case 1**
Variation on variables sum and count given the syntax of the addition operation.

```
for each example_element in number list
    sum = sum + example_element
    count++
```
**Case 2**
Variation on variables sum and count given the syntax of the addition operation.

```
for each example_element in number list
    sum =+ example_element
    count = count + 1
```
**Case 3**
Variation on variables sum and count given the syntax of the addition operation.
```
for each example_element in number list
    sum =+ example_element
    count =+ 1
```

Depending on how the parse tree is determined, the evaluation order can yield different results if the strict operands for addition logic are not evaluated given the num + sum may be parsed differently which may implicate a different result. For example if the program had incorrectly read and example_element + (sum + example element) in a different order (right to left vs left to right). There may be a discrepancy in evaluation given the variation of addition operations used in the cases[1,2,3] above. 

## 5. Rewrite the BNF grammar using Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) to enhance readability and expressiveness.

Explain the benefits of using EBNF over traditional BNF, particularly in terms of readability and clarity.
> The benefits of using EBNF over traditional BNF are that it improves the readability and clarity of the grammar
rules by making them more concise and compact. This is achieved by using brackets to indicate repetitions, grouping, and 
optional elements, which reduce the need for many rules, making it easier to follow along.

Remove any ambiguity present in the BNF grammar through syntax modifications in the EBNF version.

```
program>	        --> begin <stmt_list> end

<stmt_list>		    --> <stmt> {<stmt>}

<stmt>			    --> <assign> | <for_stmt> | <print_stmt>

<assign>		    --> <id> = <expression>

<for_stmt>		    --> for each <id> in <expression> : <stmt_list> endfor

<print_stmt>		--> print <string> + <id>

<expression>		--> <term> {(+ | /) <term>}

<term>              --> <id> | <list_literal> | <num>

<list_literal>		--> "[" <num_list> "]"

<num_list>		    --> <num> {, <num>}

<num>               --> <digit> {<digit>}

<digit>			    --> 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9

<id>                --> number | numbers_list | sum | count | average

<string>		    --> "The average of the list of numbers is"

```

## 6. Use the EBNF grammar to reconstruct a parse tree, demonstrating how the revised syntax resolves any ambiguities present in the original BNF grammar.
Analyze and compare the parse trees from Steps 4 and 7 to understand the impact of syntax modifications on the parse tree structure.
