## Overview
This repository contains Parts B and C of our Syntax and Lexical Analysis assignment.

## PART B: Syntax Description
The [average.md](https://github.com/michellealzola/CMP3020_Assignment01_Group03/blob/0601e776ad271492fe6830a901bbb514a0068cf0/PartB/average.md)
file located in the [PartB](https://github.com/michellealzola/CMP3020_Assignment01_Group03/blob/0601e776ad271492fe6830a901bbb514a0068cf0/PartB) folder contains our pseudocode, BNF and EBNF rules, and parse trees.

## PART C: Simple Lexical Analyzer and Parser
This is a simple lexical analyzer and parser program written in Python to analyze our own Python-inspired language, Serpent+. We have created a
GUI that allows users to test their Serpent+ code to check for correct syntax and view error messages. All related files are located in the 
[PartC](https://github.com/michellealzola/CMP3020_Assignment01_Group03/blob/4f30f089707ceb49d89eeb7685bf98a4136f7101/PartC) folder.

The documentation for the Serpent+ language we created can be found in the [serpent_language_documentation.md](https://github.com/michellealzola/CMP3020_Assignment01_Group03/blob/b682f89a7db1097bf8d0a49cc71f280c5371dcf0/PartC/serpent_language_documentation.md) 
file.

The valid lexemes and tokens this program analyzes can be found in the [token_lexeme.txt](https://github.com/michellealzola/CMP3020_Assignment01_Group03/blob/4f30f089707ceb49d89eeb7685bf98a4136f7101/PartC/token_lexeme.txt) 
file.
